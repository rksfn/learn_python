# Python Debugging & Code Review Masterclass

Welcome to the Python Debugging & Code Review Masterclass! This interactive course is designed for intermediate Python developers who want to enhance their debugging skills and learn effective code review techniques.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive, hands-on approach to mastering debugging in Python. By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Identify and fix common Python bugs efficiently
- Use professional debugging tools like pdb and VS Code's debugger
- Apply systematic debugging methodologies
- Perform effective code reviews
- Write more robust and error-resistant code

## Target Audience

- Python developers with intermediate language knowledge
- Programmers looking to improve their debugging efficiency
- Developers wanting to learn professional debugging tools and practices

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge (functions, classes, modules)
- Familiarity with using a terminal/command prompt
- VS Code installed (recommended for its debugging features)
- Git and GitHub account (for accessing and saving your progress)

## Course Structure

The course is organized into modules covering different aspects of debugging:

1. **Introduction to Debugging** - Fundamentals and methodologies
2. **Print Debugging** - Using strategic print statements effectively
3. **Python Debugger (pdb)** - Using Python's built-in debugger
4. **VS Code Debugging** - Leveraging VS Code's powerful debugging features
5. **Common Python Errors** - Understanding and fixing typical errors
6. **Debugging Real-World Applications** - Complex scenarios and techniques
7. **Code Review Best Practices** - Finding bugs before they happen
8. **Advanced Debugging Techniques** - Logging, profiling, and more

Each module contains:
- **Lessons** - Explanations and demonstrations of concepts
- **Exercises** - Practical problems to solve using the techniques learned
- **Solutions** - Explained solutions and best practices

## How to Use This Course

1. Follow the `setup_guide.md` to set up your environment
2. Progress through the modules in order, as each builds on previous knowledge
3. Complete the exercises before checking the solutions
4. Experiment with modifying the examples to deepen your understanding
