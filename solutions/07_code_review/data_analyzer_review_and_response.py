# PART 1: CODE REVIEW OF DATA ANALYZER MODULE
# ========================================================================
"""
Overall Assessment:
------------------
The DataAnalyzer class is well-structured and provides useful functionality for data loading, 
cleaning, analysis, and visualization. However, there are several issues that should be addressed 
to improve maintainability, extensibility, and error handling.

Key Issues Identified:
--------------------
1. Single Responsibility Principle violation - the class tries to do too many things
2. Error handling relies primarily on print statements rather than exceptions
3. Code duplication in visualization methods
4. Inflexible implementation for certain operations
5. Missing documentation
6. Lack of proper input validation in some methods
7. No test coverage
8. Resource management concerns
"""

"""
Issue #1: Single Responsibility Principle Violation
Severity: Medium
Location: Entire DataAnalyzer class

Description:
The DataAnalyzer class has too many responsibilities, handling data loading, cleaning,
analysis, and visualization. This makes the class harder to maintain, test, and extend.

Recommendation:
Split the class into smaller, focused classes following the Single Responsibility Principle:
- DataLoader: Responsible for loading and saving data
- DataCleaner: Responsible for cleaning and transforming data
- DataAnalyzer: Responsible for analyzing data (statistics, aggregation, etc.)
- DataVisualizer: Responsible for creating visualizations

Example refactoring structure:
```python
class DataLoader:
    def __init__(self, data_folder='data'):
        self.data_folder = data_folder
    
    def load_csv(self, filename):
        # Load data from CSV
    
    def save_json(self, dataframe, output_file):
        # Save data to JSON

class DataCleaner:
    @staticmethod
    def remove_duplicates(dataframe):
        # Remove duplicates
    
    @staticmethod
    def handle_missing_values(dataframe, strategy='drop'):
        # Handle missing values

class DataAnalyzer:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_statistics(dataframe, column):
        # Calculate statistics
    
    @staticmethod
    def find_correlation(dataframe, column1, column2):
        # Find correlation

class DataVisualizer:
    @staticmethod
    def create_bar_chart(data, x_column, y_column, title=None, save_path=None):
        # Create bar chart
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_line_chart(data, x_column, y_column, title=None, save_path=None):
        # Create line chart
```
"""

"""
Issue #2: Error Handling Strategy
Severity: Medium
Location: Throughout the code

Description:
The class uses print statements for error reporting and returns None/False on errors.
This makes it difficult to handle errors properly in the calling code and can lead to
silent failures.

Recommendation:
Use exceptions for error handling instead of print statements and return values.
This allows calling code to handle specific error conditions appropriately.

Example improved function:
```python
def find_correlation(self, dataset_name: str, column1: str, column2: str) -> float:
    \"\"\"
    Calculate the correlation between two numeric columns.
    
    Args:
        dataset_name: Name of the dataset
        column1: First column
        column2: Second column
        
    Returns:
        Correlation coefficient
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If dataset doesn't exist or columns are invalid
        TypeError: If columns are not numeric
    \"\"\"
    df = self.get_dataframe(dataset_name)
    if df is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Dataset '{dataset_name}' not found")
    
    # Check if columns exist
    if column1 not in df.columns:
        raise ValueError(f"Column '{column1}' not found in dataset '{dataset_name}'")
    
    if column2 not in df.columns:
        raise ValueError(f"Column '{column2}' not found in dataset '{dataset_name}'")
    
    # Check if columns are numeric
    if not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[column1]):
        raise TypeError(f"Column '{column1}' is not numeric")
    
    if not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[column2]):
        raise TypeError(f"Column '{column2}' is not numeric")
    
    # Calculate correlation
    return df[column1].corr(df[column2])
```
"""

"""
Issue #3: Code Duplication in Visualization Methods
Severity: Medium
Location: plot_bar_chart and plot_line_chart methods

Description:
The plot_bar_chart and plot_line_chart methods contain significant code duplication.
Both methods have nearly identical parameter validation, setup, and configuration code.

Recommendation:
Extract common code into a private helper method, and then call it from both
visualization methods.

Example refactoring:
```python
def _prepare_plot(self, data: pd.DataFrame, x_column: str, y_column: str, 
                 title: str = None) -> Optional[plt.Figure]:

        title: Chart title (optional)
        
    Returns:
        Figure object if successful, None otherwise
    \"\"\"

Issue #4: Inflexible Aggregation Function Implementation
Severity: Medium
Location: aggregate_data method

Description:
The aggregate_data method uses a series of if-elif statements to choose the
aggregation function, which is not scalable and makes it hard to add new
aggregation functions.

Recommendation:
Use a dictionary mapping function names to functions, or better yet, allow
passing custom aggregation functions.

Example improvement:
```python
def aggregate_data(self, dataset_name: str, group_by: str, agg_column: str, 
                  agg_function: Union[str, Callable] = 'mean') -> Optional[pd.DataFrame]:

Issue #5: Missing Class Docstring
Severity: Low
Location: DataAnalyzer class definition

Description:
There's no comprehensive docstring for the DataAnalyzer class explaining its
overall purpose and how the different methods relate to each other.

Recommendation:
Add a detailed class-level docstring that explains the purpose of the class,
its main features, and usage examples.

Example improvement:
```python
class DataAnalyzer:

Issue #6: Not Checking File Existence in load_data
Severity: Low
Location: load_data method

Description:
The load_data method doesn't explicitly check if the file exists before trying to load it,
which might lead to confusing error messages.

Recommendation:
Check if the file exists before attempting to load it, and provide a clear error message
if it doesn't.

Example improvement:

Issue #7: Demo Function Creates Files Without Cleanup
Severity: Low
Location: demo_data_analyzer function

"""
Response to Issue #1: Class has too many responsibilities

I agree that the DataAnalyzer class is doing too much and violates the Single Responsibility Principle. 
This was a concern I had while developing it, and your suggestion to split it into multiple classes 
makes a lot of sense.

I'll refactor the code into separate classes:
- DataLoader: For loading and saving data files
- DataCleaner: For data cleaning operations 
- DataAnalyzer: For analysis operations like statistics and aggregations
- DataVisualizer: For creating charts and visualizations

This will make the code more maintainable and easier to test. It will also allow users to use just 
the components they need. I'll design these classes to work well together while maintaining clear 
separation of concerns.

Priority: High - I'll implement this refactoring first.

"""
Response to Issue #2: Error handling with print statements and None/False returns

You're absolutely right about the error handling approach. Using print statements and returning 
None/False makes errors hard to handle programmatically and can lead to cascading failures that 
are difficult to debug.

I'll update the error handling to use exceptions instead:
1. Define custom exceptions for different error categories (FileNotFoundError, ValidationError, etc.)
2. Replace print statements with appropriate exception raising
3. Add proper documentation for the exceptions that each method can raise
4. Add try/except blocks in the demo code to show how to properly handle these exceptions

I'll still include logging for diagnostic purposes, but the primary error reporting will be through exceptions.

Priority: High - This is a fundamental improvement that affects all parts of the code.
"""

"""
Response to Issue #3: Code duplication in plot_bar_chart and plot_line_chart

Thank you for pointing out the duplication between these methods. I agree this violates the DRY principle 
and makes maintenance more difficult.

I like your suggestion to extract the common code into a private helper method. This will make the 
visualization methods cleaner and ensure consistent behavior across different chart types.

In addition to your suggested _prepare_plot method, I'll also consider creating a more generic 
plot_data method that takes a plotting function as a parameter, which would allow for even more 
flexibility in creating different chart types.

Priority: Medium - This is important for maintainability but doesn't affect functionality.

"""
Response to Issue #4: Inflexible aggregation function implementation

I completely agree. The current if-elif chain for aggregation functions is not scalable and makes it 
difficult to add new functions.

I'll implement your suggestion to accept either string names of common aggregation functions or 
callable functions. This will provide both convenience for common cases and flexibility for custom 
aggregations.

This change will also make the code more aligned with pandas' own aggregation capabilities, making 
it more intuitive for users familiar with pandas.

Response to Issue #5: Missing class docstring

You're right that the class lacks an overall docstring explaining its purpose and usage. This is 
important for users to understand how to use the class effectively.

I'll add a comprehensive docstring to the class that includes:
- General description of the class purpose
- Overview of its capabilities
- Usage examples
- Information about how the various methods work together

This will also be helpful for generating documentation.

Response to Issue #6: Not checking file existence in load_data

Good catch. The current implementation relies on pandas to raise an error if the file doesn't exist, 
which might not provide the most user-friendly error message.

message if the file isn't found. This will make troubleshooting easier for users.

Response to Issue #7: Demo function creates files without cleanup

That's a valid concern. The demo function currently leaves sample files in the filesystem, which 
isn't ideal for a demo.

I like your suggestion to add a cleanup parameter to control whether files are removed after the demo. 
This provides flexibility while also being respectful of the user's filesystem.

I'll implement this change and also add a comment at the beginning of the demo function clearly 
stating that it creates sample files.

Response to Issue #8: merge_datasets method creates predictable names

I agree this could lead to naming conflicts. Your suggestion to allow specifying the output dataset 
name is a good one, and I'll implement it.

Response to Missing Unit Tests

You're absolutely right that the code would benefit from unit tests. Testing is essential for ensuring 
the reliability of the code and preventing regressions.

I'll create a comprehensive test suite that covers:

- Integration tests for workflows that use multiple methods
- Edge case testing (empty datasets, missing columns, etc.)
- Test fixtures with sample data

I'll use pytest for this and structure the tests to match the refactored class organization.
